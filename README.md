## Model Architecture

## Introduction
We propose Theatergen, a tuning-free method for consistent multi-turn image generation. The key idea is to utilize LLM for character management with `layout` and `id` and customize each `character` to avoid attention leakage. We further propose the `CMIGBench` for evaluating the consistency in multi-turn image generation.

## TODO
- [ ] Deployment with GPT interface  
- [x] Release Benchmark  
- [x] Release code  

## :fire: News
* **[2024.04.26]** We have released our code and benchmark


## Setup
### ðŸ”§ Requirements

To install requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ðŸš€ Generate
Generate with `CMIGBench` or replace with your own demo

```
python generate.py --task story --sd_version '1.5' --dataset_path CMIGBench
```

### ðŸ§ª Evaluate
Prepare the output in the following format

    â”œâ”€â”€ output_dir
    |   â”œâ”€â”€ dialogue 1
    |      â”œâ”€â”€ turn1.png 
    |      â”œâ”€â”€ turn2.png 
    |      â”œâ”€â”€ turn3.png 
    |      â””â”€â”€ turn4.png 
    |   â”œâ”€â”€ dialogue 2
    |      ...

Evalutate the generated results of `CMIGBench` 

```
python CMIGBench/eval/eval.py 
python CMIGBench/eval/eval_extra.py 
```
